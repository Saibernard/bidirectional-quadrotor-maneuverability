# bidirectional-quadrotor-maneuverability
Designed, developed, and programmed a bidirectional-capable quadrotor drone with a focus on greater maneuverability in constrained environments. Worked on the design, hardware, electronics, and currently working on the programming aspects of the project from start to finish, collaborating with Phd students Jake Welde and Katie Mao.
